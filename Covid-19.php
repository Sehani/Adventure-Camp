      <h1>SAFETY & HEALTH PRECAUTIONS</h1><br>


      <P>
        Travel, as well as life in general is not the same as it was prior to Covid-19. One day, we know things will return to normal for life and for travel. In the meantime, here is what Olympia Adventures will be doing to make travel safer for all of our travelers.

      </P>

      <br>


      <p>We are participant in the Pocono Promise to ensure everyoneâ€™s safety as we again open our doors.
        We respectfully request you to do your part of the promise as we do ours.
        Together, we can continue to stop the spread while enjoying the outdoors.</p>
